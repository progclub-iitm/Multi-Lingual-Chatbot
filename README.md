# Multi-Lingual-Chatbot

Building a Chatbot that can maintain human like context and engage in conversation for long periods of time has lots of applications. This variant involved building one that can understand and respond in a mix of two languages ( English and Hindi ) like how people in countries like India talk in our daily lives. This would help us take conversational agent services to a more diverse audience who speak regional languages.
